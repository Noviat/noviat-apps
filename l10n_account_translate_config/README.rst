============================
Monolingual General Accounts
============================

This module adds on option to the Accounting Settings allowing to set translate=False
on the General Account (account.account) name field
and hence neutralise undesired multilingual account names provoked by
the localisation modules that depend on l10n_multilang (e.g. l10n_be, l10n_ch).

Installation
============

The 'l10n_account_translate_off' module must available in your addons path.
