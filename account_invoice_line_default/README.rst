=====================
Invoice Line defaults
=====================

This module facilitates the encoding of Invoices lines: 

- The 'Account' field is initialised from the default invoice account fields on the partner records.
- The 'Reference/Description' field is moved to the main page of the Supplier Invoice form
  and the Invoice Line descriptions are initialised from the Invoice Description field.
